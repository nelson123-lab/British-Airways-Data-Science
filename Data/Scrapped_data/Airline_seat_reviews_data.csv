0,Business Class,Boeing 787-9,2x3x2,May 2023,Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,,,,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Boeing 787-9 - not worth the money. The seats were extremely narrow so like lying in a coffin. When the seats were out (which is all the time on these long flights) you have to clamber over passengers to get to the toilet. The configuration of the cabin means that some one is always waking up someone else. This is an economy seat masquerading as a business class seat and is misleading and deceptive conduct because there is NO WAY you can get any rest if you book with British Airways.

2,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,3x4x3,November 2022,Couple Leisure,,,,,,4.0,4.0,no,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Did research, premium economy, looks good with extra width seats more legroom and extra recline on the seats. We had a 20 hour red eye flight LHR to SYD with a refuelling and quick crew change in SIN. Looks deceive. We were seated in row E (middle 2 of 4) centre aisle. Great, until the seat in front reclined and we discovered we were trapped. The seat arms are not retractable, (that is where the tray table is located). The distance between the arm rest and the fully reclined seat in front is under 7 inches. To extract yourself you have to wake 3 passengers, 2 in front to lift their seat backs to an upright position and the passenger to your side to allow you to lift your legs up over the arm rests. I found it impossible to watch my screen due to it being so far off vertical, it was sending me dizzy looking at it. One other problem I discovered, because I was stressed at being uncomfortable I started getting hot to find the Boeing 777 does not have individual air conditioning cold air nozzles, once the temperature is set it can’t be individually cooled. On the positive side the food was good I did however miss the coffee pot after the meal."

Outbound chose a window seat on lower deck and had one metal box under my seat that made sitting straight very difficult, so on way home opted for an upper deck seat in a set of two with my husband so I could at least get up and stretch. There was two boxes this time, and had pins and needles in my legs for not only the entire flight but for several hours afterwards. As vegan flyers we are never wowed with food, but this one was the worst yet, plain rice and vegetables. "

6,Business Class,Boeing 787-8,2x3x2,March 2020,Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,yes,,,,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was as I had experienced with all other BA flights I've had. The seats are comfortable, the bedding provided is pretty good, the food on-board (I always order an Asian Vegetarian Meal) was brilliant and the cabin crew brilliant. I sat on one of the window seats (rear-facing) and the privacy you get with the privacy divider up is pretty good. I always select the window seat on the last seat of the cabin (3A on this flight) to prevent having to step over someone else. The only possible criticism I can find for the set is the lack of storage space and how inconveniently placed the one storage bin is. BA is pretty good otherwise."
7,Business Class,Boeing 777-200,1x2x1,March 2020,Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,,,,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was disappointed at first to see I was on the Boeing 777-200 but realised it was the updated club suite cabin so wasn't sad for long. The 1-2-1 configuration is a step up from their 2-3/4-2 configuration and the privacy on the seats is pretty good. The door isn't helpful and is more of a gimmick (could've been higher). The new IFE screens are way better than the older ones, they are more clear and bright and responsive than the old IFE screens. The seats on club suite are still fabric, which in my opinion, is better than leather and more comfortable. The seats now have convenient storage bins and power ports which is a very big improvement when compared to the old club world. The seats also have adjustable armrests which make sliding out of your seat during meal services easy. The service, in general, was fantastic and very similar to other BA flights I've had. All in all club suite is a pretty big improvement over the old business cabin."

9,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3,January 2020,Solo Leisure,,,,,,,2.0,no,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Middle Row aisle seat 29D on Boeing 777-200. These aircraft are getting too old, I know BA are gradually upgrading but the seats were uncomfortable especially for a 10+ flight. The outdated entertainment system is put to shame by other airlines, you could see the squares on my one, plus you got cross over audio through the system as well from other channels. We’ll see what the return flight has to offer."
10,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3,January 2020,Couple Leisure,,,,,,3.0,3.0,no,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded to the front emergency exit seats so legroom was not a problem on the Boeing 787. But these seats are narrow and most uncomfortable.  Is this a ploy to make us upgrade to premium economy? I will not use BA next time.
11,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x4x2,January 2020,Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,,,,,,"Not Verified |  The worst business seat I’ve experienced to date. Seat was too short, my seat did not go flat and you have to step over the feet of the passenger next to you to get out also no USB port to charge my phone. I had to pay £180 to guarantee to be seated next to my partner which I’ve never had to with other airlines in business. Never again BA."
12,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x4x2,December 2019,Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,no,,,,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boeing 777 in Club World business class. We were a party of 4, 2 Adults and 2 children aged 6yrs and 10yrs. We had 1 window seat and the seat next to it, which felt claustrophobic. We also had 2 middle seats and you are sitted making eye contact with total stranger.  Yes you can shut the screen but if cabin crew having a conversation you have to put it up and down constantly.  As the 2 middle seats in the 4 middle seat configuration were together with no real screen. It was an 8 hour flight and  will not fly with British Airways again. Unfortunately it is so difficult to select seats especially booking outside the UK. Main issue is privacy!"
13,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3,November 2019,Business,,,,,,,1.0,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the misfortune of encountering these seats on a flight from London to Boston. Unfortunately, I am over six feet tall, and the larger gentleman in front of me decided to recline his seat fully and extend the head rest. There was no way for me to remain in the seat without pain. I ended up having a panic attack from the claustrophobia, and opted to stand for most of the flight. Flight attendants and staff were extremely kind, but this seat was not fit for purpose."
14,Economy Class,A320,3x3,October 2019,Business,,,,,,,1.0,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  The new A320 seats were unacceptable. Very hard and slim, no padded area, no head rest, no back support. The angle is quite strange, with a small seat base and I spent the journey in pain and in cramped conditions. May be tolerable for a very short flight but having to seat there for more than two hours is torture. There are virtually no arm rests."
15,Economy Class,A321Neo,3x3,June 2019,Business,,,,,,,2.0,no,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways have fitted out their A321 Neo with 15 rows of regular 3x3 seats at the front and then the rest of the seats are a new slim line design, similar to easyjet. The seat pitch is around 31 inch which is fine for short haul, however the new seat does not recline and features thin cushions for the seat and back rest. There is no lumber support! The seat work great for a flight that is an hour long, Kind of OK for 2 hours and poor for up to 4 hours long."
16,Economy Class,Boeing 787-9,3x3x3,October 2018,Family Leisure,,,,,,3.0,3.0,no,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very disappointed with the economy seats on the Boeing 787-9, I was in seat 33C, having not flown long haul for several years, the last time being on Malaysia 747, I felt for a flight of 13 hours the seat pitch and width were totally inadequate. 31inch seat pitch that seemed much tighter and 17.5 inch width.  Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined however the IFE screen is in your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row. Getting up and moving around the economy cabin is a bit tight too as the aisles are very narrow."
17,Economy Class,Boeing 787,3x3x3,May 2019,Couple Leisure,,,,,,,1.0,no,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"Not Verified |  Had booked with Japan Airlines unaware that our return flight was actually a codeshare with BA. On the outward JAL flight, the economy cabin seat pitch was decent so plenty of leg room. Also wherever they put the video boxes it wasn't under the seats so plenty of room to move your legs about under the seat. The return flight on BA (787) was a different story. The seat pitch is poor so my knees were practically touching the seat in front. Also, the boxes for the video are under a lot of the seats so a third of my meagre legroom under my seat was taken up by the video box. This makes for an extremely uncomfortable 12 hour flight and impossible to sleep as my legs jammed under the seat prevented me from reclining properly. JAL lets you book your seat when you make the booking. BA forces you to book no sooner than 24 hours before the flight (unless you pay them more money)."
18,Business Class,Boeing 787,2x3x2,May 2019,Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,yes,,,,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 6D, isle seat. Seat was very comfortable with ample leg room while seated or laid flat. Several storage bins available so you could store your personal items. The controls were easy to use and understand. The drawback to this isle seat is the lack of privacy. In BA 787 layout you get one or the other but not both- Privacy or direct isle access. So if this was the overnight flight I wouldn't want such open access to the isle as it would be harder to sleep as people passed by. If you are going to plan to sleep the long flight you might want a window or center seat as they are closed to foot traffic. The other odd thing about the BA layout is you are looking face to face with the person next to you, not a big deal in our case as I was seated next to my travel partner. I will say that like other 787 I've flown, the interior is looking worn and a bit beat up with obvious damage. Overall good seat, good crew, and good flight."

It's not what I expected and I was disappointed to find my knees jammed up against the seat in front - and I'm  5ft 10ins.  I like to think of BA as being a cut above the budget airlines for comfort and I'd be prepared to pay a little more for that. But, sadly, they seem to be going the same as everyone else and turning flying into a genuine hassle! Cabin staff were great."

Seat 11F an exit row window seat. Extra leg room. Wider seat as the arm rest was on the window for emergency exit. They don't serve free on-board refreshments, but the items on sale was a good selection and easily transacted. "

Very good legroom, there was arm rest missing by the window that made the seat feel wider and a lot more comfortable. All in all a very good flight. "
25,Business Class,Boeing 777,2x4x2,March 2019,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,yes,,,,,,✅ Trip Verified |  Just got off a Boeing 777 from Madrid to London Heathrow. Very good flight. I was able to travel business class this time. The service was excellent. Seat 15A a Window seat. Very good view.  Good storage features. The power socket was well placed. Foot rest was excellent and very comfortable. British Airways delivered another excellent in-flight service. Baggage handling at Heathrow Terminal 5 was excellent. My luggage was on the baggage carousel by the time I got through passport control.
26,Business Class,Boeing 777,2-4-2,March 2019,Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,no,,,,,,"✅ Trip Verified |  The Boeing 777 G-YMMR (9 yrs old) (BA2041) and G-YMMD (19 yrs old) (BA2040) we flew on between Gatwick and Cape Town have a seat configuration of 2-4-2 in Business Class. The seats are not to the latest standards in the industry. Seats feel tight and look tired and forget privacy. Passengers have no privacy except you have the window side seats as the dividers only provide little sense of privacy. But stepping over a passenger on the aisle seat is also not nice when the seat is flat. The IFE system is old with touch screen with poor quality screens which need to pressed really hard to make a selection. Further the content is not much or varied. The plus of flying BA Club World is just more legroom, not sitting in World Traveller or Premium Economy and more luggage allowance. BA Wifi is now also available. Otherwise I think BA Club World is  overpriced for what you get. It is not an amazing experience. The staff was attentive on the way to CPT but not at all on the way back to LGW. Unfortunately BA staff has quite often that attitude that you are a burden to them like ""what do you want from us"". That is not acceptable. The food was ok and nothing special and does not rectify flying Club World."

Bulkhead seats so lots of legroom but no items allowed on floor; stowage baskets are never sufficient for the blanket and pillow provided. Planes now looking and feeling very old and shabby. Seat comfortable enough with lumbar support but could do with more recline and footrest extension; width not great as kept bumping VOD remote and I'm fairly slim. VOD itself rubbish, extremely limited selection, low resolution, screen had gridlines on it. VOD stopped working during outbound flight and could not be reset. No USB power in seat. Cabin staff handed round customer service forms but not clear whether anything is forthcoming."
28,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,December 2018,Couple Leisure,,,,,,,4.0,no,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for my wife and myself to fly to Grand Cayman with BA in November 2018. The schedule was Manchester to Heathrow then Heathrow to Grand Cayman and return flights 14 days later so 8 seats in total. At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference. The scale argument does not stand up to scrutiny as the seat pitch at emergency exits are more than standard pitch."

Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complain to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat. Crew offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets at all time.  Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that."

The seats on the new planes on European flights are the smallest and most uncomfortable I have ever travelled on. I heard they were going to add more rows but as I sat I couldn't believe how little leg rooms the rows have been reduced to. I could barely sit and fit.  The worst thing is that this plane only has 1 exit row with extra leg room for a total of 6 seats for the whole plane.  in Europe.

Flying on a clearly aging 747 from Heathrow to Miami didn't start things off too well, the seat was very narrow for premium economy, noticeably narrower than Virgin, legroom was fine though. We were greeted with a glass of champagne which was a nice touch, oddly on the return Orlando to Gatwick run we had a choice of orange juice or water, disappointing to say the least. As far as perks go that was it. Food ran out so we ended up with economy food, nice but not fantastic. The back seat TV was old fashioned, small in size compared to other airlines and had a very limited choice, all in all both flights were very disappointing. One other thing we found odd was no toilet in the premium economy area of the 777 from Orlando to Gatwick, we had to use economy class toilets some twenty rows behind us. For the money we paid we expected a lot better."

The seat itself was quite comfortable, with a good seat pitch and a decent recline (we were in the back row so didn't need to worry about ruining someone else's journey by reclining into their faces). The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it ""spinach and ricotta ravioli"", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, ""Fillet of beef with broccolini"", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful. If you're travelling to London at the back of the cabin bring your own meal with you or you may end up going hungry."

On the old seat, the screens were only the size of my hand and there was no power outlets - On the new seat, the screens were nice sized, there was plenty of power outlets and just a clean seat.

Seat recline was very limited and foot rest was very flimsy. The control for the in flight entertainment is in the side of the seat so you regularly brush it just sitting in the seat which can turn the entertainment off or pause the video. The screen for the entertainment was amongst the smallest i have seen and much smaller than economy class on other aircraft types. The entertainment kept skipping and had to be reset just after take off which meant no entertainment access for 30 mins. The leg room pitch was pretty good. A lot of the blinds were broken in some way so a lot of light poured into the cabin and as this was an overnight 10 hr flight that was not idea. They need to refurbish these old 747s desperately. The seat power point in word traveller plus is the old empower connection. No one uses this connection type anymore. it needs to be changed. It's like having a car with a CD player.

We will never use BA for long-haul economy flights again or recommend others to do so. Although cabin staff were excellent, seat space (pitch and width) were awful, so much so that we dreaded the return flight (outbound, Airbus 380, February 18; inbound Boeing 747, March 18). Each of us is below average UK height so we hesitate to think about the likely discomfort for other passengers. When the seat in front was reclined, getting access to the aisle from a non-aisle seat (e.g. to use a toilet) needed contortions worthy of a circus performer on each flight.The seat reclining mechanism on my return flight was broken and added to my own already-cramped discomfort.

There was only a footer rest which is certainly not enough. The button for the seat adjustment/recliner was extremely hard to press. The other passenger seated beside me also made the same comment on the difficulty to get the seat to recline or be pushed back up due to the tightness of the button for the seat adjustment.

Perhaps it is my age (> than 60) but I have always had to use my pillow to pad my seat cushion on Jet's aircraft: cost-cutting by stealth? BA was a revelation.  BA's World Traveller seat in an elderly Boeing 777 was infinitely more comfortable than Jet Airways Boeing 777. Well done!

Compared to Premium on a 380 etc - this is a bad joke. Business class seemed to have been updated - but nothing else. Cannot understand how a company can take the same money for 2 vastly different experiences. Repairs had been made with duct tape.

As I got into my seat, the headrest had fallen down and so had the rest of them on my row, and the flight attendants couldn't do anything about it. They couldn't fix it so I had to fly with a sore neck and a beam sticking into my spine.

Flew to Iceland with wife and daughter. As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched. We fly business as a family numerous times to Australia each year and we never choose BA because of the generally rubbish service on short haul flights. I'd rather spend the big bucks where I can be guaranteed good service (Singapore etc). I really will now avoid BA and try some of the other carriers as there are too many poorly trained rude people working for BA."

On the major plus side, it's an exit row on a long-haul jet so there's essentially unlimited legroom, plus zero danger of someone in front reclining so far their head's in your lap. It's both exit row and an aisle, so you have almost all the space in the world - until you realise you've paid $63 for zero in-seat storage and zero notification from BA of this fact. There's no seat pocket, no nothing. After the couple sharing an OHL with me insisted their bag be placed on top (because mine looked ""heavy""?) I -- being only 5'2""ft tall and therefore unable to access overhead bags without assistance felt obliged to keep my phone, portable charger, headphone, boarding pass, passport and landing card all in my seat with me on a 12 hour flight.

It is not possible to sit naturally; one must sit with legs at an angle and with your feet together and the space does not permit any items to be placed at your feet. In addition, the overhead bins are undersized and will not accommodate even an approved carry on. The window is also extra small and difficult to see out of. (The window passenger does get an extra storage space along the wall). The entertainment screen is quite small. Finally, the galley serving other classes on the upper deck is located directly behind the small economy section and the food preparation smells are oppressive. On the other hand, the middle bank of 4 seats upstairs is a good option, as seats there have good foot room and the cabin is more intimate than seating on the main lower deck."

Aircraft cleanliness was below standard. The menu card given was not meant for the sector (was meant for the next leg of journey Singapore to Sydney). Therefore food of choice was not available and no apology rendered. No headsets nor blanket provided on seat and subsequent to request to the crew, none was delivered. The food served was below standards. Request for a second bottle of water was met with a curt - finish this one and we will refill.

The seats felt quite hard, and became really uncomfortable after a few hours. The seat pitch is just OK for someone like me who is 184 and just had knee surgery. I preferred the old seats for comfort. The IFE was of great quality, and plenty of movies to chose from. The noise cancelling headphones are good for premium economy. But there is a very bad design flaw with the seats: they cannot be brought back to the upright position without the help of a flight attendant pushing the back up. Also, it is almost impossible for the person sitting in a middle seat to get up during the night. Last but not least, there are no dedicated washrooms for premium economy - actually only a total of 4 for all the upper deck economy and premium economy passengers (and always as usual on BA, one of them is reserved for the crew)"

The aircraft was dirty with a thick layer of dust between the window seat and the cabin wall. There were cup ring marks on the arms and the seats were the most uncomfortable I think I have sat on for a long flight of nearly 9 hours in any class including economy. The cushion area was devoid of any 'cushioning' and the seats were worn and old looking. The TV had a screen not much bigger than my mobile and the quality was so poor I decided that I would use my phone and listen to the music for the entire trip home. This is the first time I have ever felt that I could not tolerate the poor screen quality. I had to wear my glasses just to try and follow the on screen commands. The only positive was that the earphones provided worked well on my phone and the noise cancelling removed most of the inflight noise. At a time when BA seem to be moving away from their prestige airline image that has been their selling point for many years I really can not understand why customers travelling long distances should have to be transported in such awful planes. My only serious satisfaction is that I did not accept the offer to upgrade to business. First of all the price offered was too much and secondly when I checked out the business class it did not look in anyway inviting. As stated this review is for the 747-400 used on the return Seattle to LHR and this is a seat/aircraft type review and my comments are honest and accurate.

One person sat in front of me had a broken seat, and it kept reclining beyond anything I have ever seen before, he was virtually sat on my knee, The stewardess said, ""I'll have to fix that"", like she could have done, and left it at that. It was embarrassing for the person in the seat as well as annoying for me. I was able to move a family member to an empty seat, and then vacate that situation. However, when the person sat in front of my new seat fully reclined his chair, I was also hemmed in so much it was nearly impossible to get up to go to the toilet. The same thing happened to me on the return flight. How can a fully reclined seat leave you unable to get up to go to the toilet without pushing the person in front and waking them up. This is not acceptable, the TV screen was about one foot from my face and as someone who suffers claustrophobia, it was an horrendous flight. I have never had this on any other airline and I fly several times a year. This is the first and last time I will ever fly BA."

On the subsequent short haul flight LHR to EDI the width of the seats were greater than that of the long haul one. Makes no sense.

While many premium economy seats are wider at 19+ inches with around 38 inch pitch and 8-9 inch recline, BA premium economy are narrower at 18.5"" (similar to the width of a Singapore Airlines economy). Nevertheless, there is enough space for the elbows, and ample legroom given the pitch. Although, if you are sitting at the aisle, there is an odd-looking entertainment box between the two seats in front of you and railings directly under your feet - which could make the placement of your legs somewhat tricky. The padding is comfortable, even for long-haul flights but there is no leg rest (again contrasts some competitors). AVOD is responsive and has a good selection. Screens are 10.6"" wide, somewhat too small in the upright position - unless the passenger in front of you is in full-recline, in which case the screen will be on your lap and you can forget about eating, using laptop, or doing any useful activity."

The biggest issue is the lack of space under the seat in front of you due to the in-flight entertainment (IFE) boxes. I was in seat 31A and the box took up three quarters of the space. It was so wide I could rest my feet on it. I was lucky the middle seat was empty so I could put my bag under that seat and if I sat on the angle could stretch my feet out under the middle seat.

No snacks/napkins with the drinks (we used to get a bag of nuts, lemon slices and a napkin) and no hot meals. On a 3 1/2 hour flight we were served the equivalent of a meal-deal. Coffee and tea are also not automatically provided. The staff were fantastic and surely there is more than enough time to serve a hot meal. Instead we were presented with a box containing a cheese and ham sandwich (or egg and tomato), a 2x1 inch slice of cheese with 2 crackers and a chocolate dessert the size of a small shot glass. Legroom has been reduced too. On the outward flight we had no video either. No value for money. I would strongly recommend budget airlines where tickets cost considerably less and one may bring their own meal-deal on board or local airlines where for the same price-range as BA one is served drinks with snacks, a hot meal followed by tea or coffee. BA is missioned to take passengers' money and give the least possible in return."

The undercarriage of the seats in-front prohibited much of the area to put your feet during the flight. Due to the seats being made narrower to fit in more seats across the plane they do not give you much wiggle room, which is essential for a long haul flight. The gentleman in front of me had his chair reclined the whole journey which forced me to do the same, which became a domino effect throughout the plane as you are unable to see the small TV screen in front of you. The power supply in economy was a single USB point next to the screen area, which is limiting if you need to use a laptop or a device not using a USB for charging."

London to Bangalore. Seat 12A in Premium Economy. Bulkhead seat so plenty of legroom. Seat width OK. A bit hard on the posterior - using the supplied cushion helped. To be honest if you are a light sleeper you're better off with a flat bed in Business. Headrest not easily adjustable unlike the newer Economy seat. No power or storage, only a connection for headphones. Headphones supplied were good - better than the in-ear ones in Economy. Also received eyeshades, ear plugs (horrid), socks, a toothbrush and toothpaste. Plenty of food - main meal 2hrs after takeoff followed by breakfast 2hrs before landing. VOD poor, on a bulkhead seat it is on an arm which doesn't really stay at the required angle. Lots of screen burn on this particular unit as well. Selection of movies and TV shows not up to par with the Middle Eastern airlines. Overall feeling was that the plane and decor were a bit tired. Cabin crew perfunctory but not hugely friendly.

Economy class foot space under the seats is a complete joke. In a row of 3 seats we had 2 large boxes which I assume houses IFE control equipment. I am 5'7"", and was sat at a window seat. The box (the size of a desktop pc) is placed in such a way you can only stretch out one leg unless you sat diagonally in your seat. For a 10 hour flight was very poor. Also seats in front seem to either recline back further or are thicker than older models as when the seat came back, the screen was about 10inches from your face, so very difficult to view the screen so close. Poorly designed for a new plane. Flew back on one of the older, but better designed planes for long haul flights. Would recommend the airline, but not the choice of plane for long journeys."

When the plane landed at Heathrow, we disembarked via a door behind Club Europe seats. Staff did not allow us to go first thus making it a mad dash for the door. There were many older people in Club Europe and they seemed fairly overwhelmed. Club Europe bags were last out and therefore we had to wait over half an hour for our bags.

I consider it extortion to charge a family that much money to guarantee seats together for long international flights (almost 22 hours total). One of my family members has severe flight anxiety. It's a disservice to our family and to the stranger who may potentially be seated next to her. This is a cheap, greedy means of extracting more money from customers. (And BTW, I'm not talking about exit row or special seats - these are regular coach seats, including even a middle seat.)

I used 30,000 miles I believe to upgrade to World Traveler Plus (Premium Economy). My first complaint was with the worn out cloth that covered the seats. There were tears in the fabric and the foam padding in the seats is clearly in need of replacement. My second complaint is that there was no power point at my seat. The AVOD system was a joke. We left London Gatwick Airport and they rebooted the system 4 times because it would not work. Sometime around the third hour into the flight it began to work, but my screen was so scratched and dull that it did not matter, I couldn't watch anything on it. All I could see was a washed out echo of a picture.  BA has stated time and time again that all of their 777-200's have been upgraded with the new cabin. Well I am here to tell you they are lying. This plane we were on was a piece of junk. I have my return flight tomorrow, and I am dreading getting the same plane. It is the London to Tampa (Disney) service, so why bother spending money upgrading the plane when it is constantly full of families spending their hard earned money - expecting great things from BA - but BA providing a very poor service. I believe BA is taking part in a bait and switch tactic with their planes, trying to get people to upgrade a cabin while showing them Boeing Dreamliner's and Airbus A380's, but unless you are flying to New York or Boston you end up on one of their junkers, having wasted your miles.

I have always found British Airways food and service to be better than the average and they recognise loyalty with some good perks when you have silver or higher status. But my biggest disappointment is they have invested all this money into new economy cabins with new IFE, and have taken up half of the passenger foot space with the largest equipment boxes I have ever seen on an airline. You could maybe try to excuse it on their refitted older aircraft, but for brand new aircraft like the A380, it's inexcusable. I have flown the A380 on Emirates, Etihad, and BA, and the former 2 have IFE systems that are a league ahead of BA, yet there isn't a single equipment box to be seen anywhere. With BA, in a single row of 10 seats, there are at least 6 of these boxes.

These are the best seats in the plane now that there is no difference in seat pitch between Club and Economy. However they become really uncomfortable after a couple of hours, so this flight is an endurance test for the back. The quid pro quo on the extra legroom is that these seats do not recline (the other rows do have some recline but not much) which makes the discomfort more acute. Good seat width too even with three blokes in row - cabin on A320 seems wider than B737.

Premium Economy seats don't recline much; barely any more than Economy. Flat and hard, which leaves your bottom numb after a while.

Now they charge you (even their loyalty card holders!) if you are travelling without a checked in bag & want to change the terrible seat they have assigned you. And British Airways are doing it in a very sly way, in my opinion. I have flown 3 times with them during the last month. Each time with a colleague. And on every occasion the seats have been assigned to us at the very rear of the plane, and every time without a window seat. They've done this despite plenty of free seats being available in the mid & front of the plane. There is only 1 reason - they do it specifically to force you to pay for a seat change. Have a look at the seat map from todays flight that I have attached. Despite there being numerous free seats around, they've put us at the back of the plane and on both sides of an aisle so we cant even talk together comfortably. And I was checking in only a few minutes after the online check in opened - so there was no lack of available seats. There are some other airlines also charge for seat selection, but normally they are low cost carriers. British Airways charges premium fees for its seats and is a national carrier. This is pure greed. If you don't take a checked in bag, you are saving BA money. So why should they punish you in return? They save time/money on loading the plane - on staff at the check in desk - on downtime at the gate - on risk due to terror hype - on paying to replace lost baggage and  belongings and on fuel due to less weight etc. They should reduce the ticket price, not increase it! I urge you to give BA a miss until they change this policy. There are plenty of other airlines who value their frequent flyers."

The crew made some checks and informed us that the problem could not be fixed. For the next 10 hrs, the affected passengers just had to endure the situation. We could not watch movies or read or do work on computers as this was a night flight and all lights were switched off after the meal service. It was distressing to see British Airways crew treat the situation nonchalantly. "
110,Premium Economy,Boeing 767,2x2x2,July 2015,Couple Leisure,,,,,,,1.0,no,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,"As I wanted to ensure that both my wife and I sat together in Club Europe part of the cabin, I was constantly checking the availability of seats. So I checked on Sat, 18th and Sunday 19th and on both occasions the only seats that were available were 2+2+1+1+1, so 7 in total. Therefore I felt that I could not wait until Tues, 21st for online check in, as I wanted to ensure that I sat next to my wife. So with that in mind I pre-booked 2 seats 15a and 15b to ensure that we sat together and the extra £50. However, when I checked the seat availability again on Mon, 20th and Tues 21st, I was shocked to see that there were plenty of seats available. When I saw this I felt I had been forced and cheated by BA to pay an extra £50, this left a bitter taste in my mouth and was angry with the way I had been treated by BA. The flight was delayed for 1 hour 40mins without an explanation as to why. Ok, these things happen but an explanation as to why were were delayed would have been appreciated.  By the time the cabin crew came round with the supposed lunch, it was close to 3pm and by the time the cabin crew reached us, they could not offer us a choice of food and the only thing that was left, was Fish. Therefore we were left with 2 trays of front of us with a salad bowl, a bread roll, an empty cup and an empty glass and a napkin with various cutlery, totally useless if you have no food to eat.  Eventually crew managed to find a Chicken dish that we could eat. The Club Europe cabin was not sectioned off to the economy class passengers. So these passengers were constantly walking past us to use the toilet facilities that were meant for Club Europe passengers.  After several complaints from myself and fellow passengers did they make an announcement over the PA about the facilities. However this did not stop the constant flow of passengers"

Left leg sort of lost feeling, right leg could stretch out, and that was the constant struggle I had to deal with. If the front passenger fully reclines, there goes the space which you thought you had. The seat is pretty much over the tray tables, watching a movie whilst eating was a delicate balancing act. Overall, decent but there are better airlines for long haul flights."

It was an overnight flight from Philadelphia to London. I am not a big person (163cm tall, 52kg) but I had to scrunch my shoulders together to fit in the seat. I had pins and needles for 24 hours after the flight. Other people around me who were larger than me (but not 'big' people by any stretch of the imagination) had to keep their arms folded for the whole flight in order to fit in the seat. Lots of people were complaining. I emailed a complaint to BA, which was met with ""sorry to hear, hope it hasn't deterred you from flying with us again"". A disgusting way to treat your passengers. I would rather pay more to travel with anyone than BA ever again after this experience."

We were in 31/B on the way to London and in 30J/K on the way back to Chicago. 31 A/B were better because there was no one behind us. The seats were fairly comfortable, but not comfortable enough for us to really sleep. The arms were really hard and could not be raised because they contained the trays. If the center one could have been raised to make more room it would have helped a lot. I could not really stretch out because of a metal box under the seat in front of me. From reviews I have read of other airlines' premium economy seats, these were good. A pillow, blanket, and eye mask were provided. I am a vegetarian and had a special meal which was all right as was my husband's meal. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. The movies were fine too."

There is reasonable leg room provided you have nothing stashed away there or the IFE box does not get your way. Even with the tray table up, though, window seat passengers have no way of getting out to the washroom without having the other two passengers get up and out into the aisle. That makes you really popular in the middle of a long overnight flight! The back support is reasonable, but after a few hours the seat bottom starts to feel hard. Overall you feel totally cramped and hemmed in. I'll never fly it again."

Despite the enhancements made to the interior aesthetics of the short-haul fleet, a fare paying Club Europe passenger is bound to be left less than impressed. Since the refitting and ""upgrade"" to the new seat, the legroom is completely inadequate. It is now impossible to stretch out, work on a normal sized laptop, and in my opinion has rendered Club Europe basically a redundant product compared. "

118,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,I flew SYD-LHR return trip having recently had surgery on my left leg. Outbound I stood up for 7 hours from SYD-SIN as cabin crew decided my leg was sticking out too far and there was insufficient room to get my leg under the seat. On the return my seat offered better leg room but despite many empty seats BA allocated two large men next to me. I had to have my carry on case to keep my leg elevated which meant the two men were trapped in their seats. BA didn't ask to see my Dr's letter to understand what I was going through. The staff did their very best to avoid all eye contact with passengers (presumably in case we asked for something!). My headset socket didn't work but the staff just blamed the previous crew. I could write about the state of the toilets but I'd rather forget what I saw. Suffice to say I drank nothing on the flight to ensure a bathroom visit was not required. My experience with BA has left me quite certain I will never book them again.
119,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,Flying from London to Mauritius and back. On way out footrest not working - broken and reported to crew who did nothing. Reported to BA on arrival. Return to LGW 2 weeks later same run down aircraft seat not fixed and in addition my wife's was broken as well this time. Reported to crew again and an engineer did a temporary fix before take-off. It soon broke again! Didn't have dinner it was 1am but breakfast was the worst I have been presented with in over 40 years of frequent flying a grey/green omelette and undercooked sausage - I did not eat it. It was an old WT+ cabin and even if they had been properly working the seats are not good. Food same as Economy drinks from plastic and paper cups. It really is a very poor product and BA should be ashamed of it. I would not travel with BA long haul in this cabin ever again as it offers poor value for money and great discomfort. Save up to go Club if at all possible or choose another airline on the same route whose Premium Economy lives up to what it claims.
120,Economy Class,A319,3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Beware of seats 25A/B on the new layout in the A319. They are placed where one of the toilets used to be. There is no window and it feels cramped and claustrophobic. You are also adjacent to the door of the one remaining toilet so expect smells and long queues next to you for most of the flight.

Sat in seats 71a 71b going over 81a 81b coming back - most uncomfortable seats ever and what's with the entertainment box being under the seat in front of you. I am only 5'2"" tall and had no room for my feet because of this box and the Middle armrest only goes half way up. We have flown long haul many times and this would have to be the worst experience ever."
122,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,We had flown LAX to Heathrow in BA World Traveller plus seats 2x4x2 and were able to survive - but on the return in the standard Economy seats it was awful. It was inhumane! If the seat in front reclines you are trapped. The armrest won't come all the way up so a large person has an awful time getting out of their seat. I would hate to be in the middle of a row. Very bad and unhealthy seating.
123,Economy Class,A380,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,"I flew from Hong Kong to London. After a code share on an old Cathay Pacific plane I was looking forward to flying on one of the new A380s. I was quickly disappointed however. BA have decided to cram people in on this new plane. The legroom and general seat comfort was very poor. I only fly BA as I travel a lot with work and use BA for EU flights but I won't fly long haul with them again. It's disgraceful the tiny amount of room they give while continually saying ""enjoy your flight"". It is a matter of endurance not enjoyment."
124,Premium Economy,Boeing 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Just returned from London into Vancouver. Seats are not comfortable. You could get jammed into a wretched four in a row middle seat. Leg room and recline marginal. Food horrific. Service average. Scratchy blanket. TV screen kept freezing and acting up. Just economy with a little bit more leg room and given the lack of comfort not worth it. I will never book this again and will not fly British Airways again - part of it is just a feeling of the crew not caring very much. Not very pleasant either being sandwiched between business class and first class which had lovely cabins service and reclining seats. Felt like a lower class citizen with the red rope across the curtains to first class. The food was horrific. No priority boarding. Last bags to be let off in Vancouver.
125,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,London to Bangkok 12 hour flight. Seat in front was in full recline position for 10 of those hours. Couldn't see the tv screen in front of me as too close with the recline position of person in front. Felt very claustrophobic and couldn't sit comfortably as no leg room - sat at an angle and now very stiff. Endurance test!
126,Premium Economy,Boeing 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,I have travelled long haul premium economy with a number of other airlines and have not used BA service for long haul before. However this trip was by some margin the worst I have experienced on long haul. I fear BA's hype about investment in premium economy seats is ill founded and after some 24 hours in the same seat broken by stop for refuel in Singapore I came into Heathrow sore from the seat. The service was satisfactory and when I became ill on one leg of the flight staff couldn't have been more helpful. But the seat discomfort was such that I would only choose BA for long haul as a last resort.
127,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Flew with my daughter from London Heathrow to Dubai on Valentines Day. This is a terrible product offered from BA. Have flown Virgin Premium Economy which knocks the socks off this BA product? Seats are incredibly uncomfortable - both recline and leg rest allow no comfortable position. There is no sense of a premium product. Bitterly regret booking BA for this trip and dreading return flight. Considered upgrading to Club but would cost an additional £2900 pp! again.
128,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,Dubai to LHR I have never had such uncomfortable seats bar the likes of Easyjet etc. It was a shame as it was an upgraded cabin so had new IFE etc only good thing! No seat padding they also seem to have narrower seats than the old style. But what really bugs me is that we have to use the same loos as the 200+ people behind me nothing personal but it's yucky. I couldn't eat either meal choice so got stitched with an economy meal. Miserable Staff as well.
129,Economy Class,BOEING 777-300,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,The economy class seats at rear of B777-300 are very comfortable with good stretch of legs possible and good lumber support. I like the winglet headrest too.
130,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,The legroom is equivalent to a cheap charter short haul. The TV screen is ancient and poor quality . never again! Behind me was a tall man with his knees in my back who simply had no where else to put them. When I discussed it with him it was almost an air rage incident. I doubt the staff would have resolved it. He simply did not fit the seat. The flight from LHR to MIA was an hour extra sitting on the ground due to a cargo mess up.
131,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,The plane is new and the seat is comfortable even there is not enough legroom and in the configuration 3x3x3 the window seats are really difficult to reach. The entertainment system is great and the way the screens are built makes what you're watching not visible to the other passenger.
132,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,Seats 12A & 12B are the best seats in the cabin then 11J & 11K as they are bulkhead seats and you have the benefit of nobody reclining a seat in front of you both sets of seats give more legroom but 12AB give the most 12A and 11K are infant bassinet positions so these are not usually available to reserve until 24 hours before departure unless you are travelling with an infant. The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side. All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium ecnomy (world travelller plus as BA call it) especially if you can get seats in the pairs of AB/JK rather than the 4 in the middle. Window seats can be difficult to get out of when the person next to you in the aisle seat is in a reclined position and asleep.
133,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Flew from LHR to BKK return with British Airways. Do this trip regularly with Thai and I will be going with them on my next trip. I only used BA as they were offering relatively cheap flights on offer but this turned out to be a major faux pas. BA were frankly awful and I wouldn't consider flying with them again.
134,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,Terrible seat configuration on BA A380 economy upper deck. Seat space is cramped and arm rest can't be fully up. It hanged at an angle which is dangerous and inconvenience when u are travelling with a child.
135,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,LHR-ORD-LHR I was pleased to see that the return flight was on a new 777 with larger monitors. I had a window seat 41K on BA296. However this was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. I am 6' tall. I had absolutely no legroom with my knees pressing into the seat in front. This became even more uncomfortable once the passenger in front reclined their seat. I could not move my legs due the large entertainment system metal box on the floor immediately in front of where my right foot should rest forcing me to shift my foot far to the right. It was almost impossible to get up from my seat and get to the aisle with the seats in front reclined. I could not open my laptop on the table. I am a medical doctor. This cramped uncomfortable posture and difficulty in getting up to walk must considerably increase my risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This was more cramped than any budget airline I have been on. Having been a loyal BA customer for decades I will now never fly with BA again. Really disappointing.
136,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,31C very cramped the seats feel smaller than other aircraft in the fleet in Economy. Once I had put my books and newspaper in the pocket in the seat in front my knees were right up against it. The table is very small. The biggest gripe I would have is legroom this is severely hampered by the In Flight entertainment box being placed under the seat in front.
137,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,As I am now retired I fly long haul at least three trips a year. I also upgrade to premium economy as at 6foot 2 inches the seat pitch of 31 inches is crippling. On 1/10/2014 I flew BA 274 from Las Vegas to LHR BA premium economy the aircraft was old and tired and although the pitch was adequate I was budged up beside my next door passenger. Needless to say I will not be flying BA again as I object to paying thousands for business. Why do the various Far East Airlines give so much more for your money.
138,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,We had a miserable experience flying directly from Phoenix to Heathrow and back. The seating was much more cramped than in the past with little leg room nowhere to rest elbows and inevitable physical contact with the person next to you. When the passenger in front of you reclines the seat you're even more cramped. There need to be some limits/rules about it. It's flight rage waiting to happen.
139,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,You can't get out of the seat into the aisle as the arm-rest doesn't move so you have to haul yourself out. the length of the seat is terrible I am short but it finished half way along the thigh. If the seat in front is reclined you have your screen literally touching your face the toilets are no better than a charter flight airline the staff are only interested in the business/higher classes. Overall a very bad experience.
140,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,You're paying for leg room. That's the only benefit. A tremendous benefit yes but it's still an airplane getting you from A to B long-haul. Presumably had same food as Club World (this was a three- class airplane) no preflight bubbly. Outbound flight overnight -- seemed like an airborne campground with litter everywhere. Homebound in daylight much neater. Pricey. Can't see me sitting in economy for ten hours over eleven hours back. Wedged in. Leg room is worth it.
141,Economy Class,BOEING 787,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,More like nightmare than Dreamliner! Appalling leg room suitable for amputees only! Wider seat offered for $300 one way! Service and food good except for cake in cellophane for breakfast.
142,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,The seats were not very comfortable and you can feel the movement of the person sat behind you each time they retrieve/search for something in the seat pocket. The video screen were also very small and the resolution was low.
143,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-200,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,Gatwick to Tampa in premium economy a plane which had new premium economy. The seats were comfortable good leg room (I'm 6ft) and good recline. Cabin crew were great and friendly.
144,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,SFO-LHR in 28J in the old iteration of World Traveller Plus. These seats are really uncompetitive when compared to the new WTP seats on BA's A380s and some 777s and Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy seats. While I was happy with legroom and access to aisles the seats are hard cramped and rather uncomfortable. BA have no plans to upgrade this cabin as they slowly retire their large 747 fleet. This is a pity because I will actively avoid routes this seat this seat is featured on giving my business to Virgin Cathay or EVA's superior Premium Economy products or alternative BA flights on newer aircraft with the new seats when available.
145,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-300ER,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,"We were in WT+ seats 23 A and B from LHR to SEA. On this 777-300 we had the ""new"" World Traveler Plus seats. The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front. While the new WT+ has its short-comings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product. For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT+ was far less than what we would have paid for Club World."
146,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,"We flew SEA-LHR on an aging 747-400 in World Traveler Plus seats 29 J and K near the 3R door. BA boards WT+ dead last. The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA's long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it's true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep. On the other hand WT+ is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product (e.g. Delta ""economy comfort"" on its 767-300 on the same SEA to LHR route)."
147,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,This had to be the most uncomfortable flight in the world we flew American airlines LHR-MIA 777-300er and the seats were comfy and the flight entertainment worked. On the way back we flew BA from MIA-LHR and it was really bad I do not recommend sitting in row 33-36 as the leg room is reduced and the seats are uncomfortable I had a headphone set that didn't work and a box under the seat in front of me so I didn't have any leg room for my left foot now me being 6ft something and as a 15 year old teenager who likes a bit of leg room found it difficult to find some. I had flown from PLS-MIA before that flight to LHR but couldn't get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs. I am willing to give BA another go but I might go premium economy or even club world. Not a good flight at all do not sit in seat 35G!
148,Premium Economy,AIRBUS A380,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,I am a seasoned business traveller and on long haul flights I tend to use Premium economy if available. Usually the extra cost is about £500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a £500 premium in the seat £300 tops. (I have just had a look at the BA web site and the same return flights as mine for next week has an £1800 premium utter madness)
149,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9 hour flight from Houston to Heathrow. Very uncomfortable. When seat in front is suddenly reclined you can get scalded if you have a hot drink on your table. Seats terribly narrow and obstructions in the way of your feet as well. Entertainment system is poor. All the music is American and the film choice is terrible. Difficult to get in and out of seat if not in an aisle seat. Will not be doing this length of journey again unless I can get a reasonably priced upgrade.
150,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,World traveller plus on a long haul flight to Abu Dhabi from UK and it was fantastic. The level of service from staff was excellent the seats were comfy with lots of leg room and width.
151,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,I flew over on the 740pm flight from PHX. The seats were very uncomfortable. The headrest was a bit odd and it didn't allow for a consort able sleep. My video screen volume was not right with only one speaker functioning and the volume was very low. It was also difficult to get the crews attention. I was a Very loyal fan go US AIR (y93k248) and am a silver member but thought I would give BA a try because of the non stop option from PHX to Heathrow. I probably will change back to USAIR.
152,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,This was my first experience in World Traveler Plus. I have traveled coach and business previously. It is an improvement on coach in terms of legroom and seat comfort the cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery. (How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen. One factor in favour of coach is that the hand-rests fold back so that if you're lucky enough to be the sole passenger in a row of 3 or 4 you can lie across the seats and enjoy a business class standard lie-flat bed. The World Traveler plus armrests are fixed.
153,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,Do not waste money upgrading from economy. I paid 2 x GBP300. The cabin is poorly thought out we were left begging for water as you are competing with 200+ Economy passengers for service toilets and snacks. The cabin was shabby seats in disrepair and video screens faulty - just as tired and knackered as the cabin crew who treated the Premium Economy passengers as an after thought. Example - the passageway going aft to the toilets was blocked by crew dealing with a sick economy passenger one cabin crew let PE passengers go forward into the Business class cabin for the toilet another actually shouted at PE passengers for doing the same. On the way back they ran out of meals and gave us the same meal as economy. Absolute waste of money - never felt so looked down upon by cabin crew.
154,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,Nightmare overnight Jo'Burg to Heathrow. No room for elbows with next passenger. Passenger in front put seat back and complained that my husband knees were in his back! husband spent night walking plane as front passenger would not move his seat . Need to reduce amount of seat recline!
155,Economy Class,AIRBUS A320,3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,All other seats apart from the last row (27) are fine in Euro Traveller class. I do not recommend row 27 at all. I will be cautious next time and select a row further forward. Not comfortable.
156,Premium Economy,BOEING 767,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I injured my knee while in London so I decided to pay the extra £125 to upgrade from Economy to Premium Economy and it was so worth it. I will definitely upgrade from now on if the price is reasonable. I was fortunate to have the aisle seat on the 4 seat center row and the seat beside me was empty! There was so much more leg room that I was comfortably able to stretch me bad knee out. The seat felt a bit wider too. I believe the food was the same that's served in Economy which on BA is pretty tasty. The only difference was that they came around with a basket of warm rolls tastier than the freezing cold ones you usually get. At the beginning of the flight they gave out warm damp hand towels very refreshing. Only problem was the couple in front of me reclined their seats all the way back the minute that they sat down. The person's head was basically in my lap. Unbelievable rude. I had to ask the flight attendant to request that they raise their seat during meal service or I wouldn't have been able to eat. I wish the airlines wouldn't have seats that recline into the lap of the passenger behind them a little recline is okay but too far just doesn't work.
157,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,2.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,The seats that I had on the outward and return journey from London Heathrow to the Gulf were comfortable with good head support and good back support when the cushion was used. The audio/visual screen was OK and I found it easy to get some sleep. Big problem - the leg room is no better than a budget airline so when the person in front reclines their seat it is very tight and difficult to eat this was really annoying. at least budget airline seats don't recline.
158,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-200,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,First time flying to and from Hong Kong In this aircraft and first time choosing World Traveller plus for some comfort. What a mistake on both counts. Seats shabby narrow hard and generally very uncomfortable. Not enough toilets to serve economy and economy plus on a 13 hour flight. Above seat lockers dropping open on take off lap tray falling apart. Absolutely the worst plane and long haul journey I have experienced. Do not waste money on World Traveller plus and preferably never choose a British Airways B777 for long haul travel.
159,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Traveled Heathrow to Orlando Premium Economy and it was very poor. Seat dirty Seat recline didn't work Food poor drink offered with food and then nothing for 6 hours. Exactly same on return.
160,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,London to Bangkok. I was allocated a middle seat and could not change it when I checked in very early. The seat is a little wider and there is a little more legroom than in economy class but for an over night flight not really much more comfortable. The man in the aisle seat next to me put on his eye shields and the blanket over his head as soon as the plane took off. he ate no meals. It was with the greatest difficulty that I was able to get out of the seat to reach the aisle particularly when the seat in front was reclined in fact almost impossible. The TV screen is very small and in my case fell out of it's housing and despite efforts by the crew to hold it in place with sticky tape they were not successful. The food was good and better than ordinary economy. But I did not consider the extra money for the premium class seat well spent for a single traveller. It would be better for a party of two who could choose the seats at the side.
161,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,Seat: 33H (LHR-SIN). Right side of the plane first row in economy which is an aisle seat at the bulkhead so you have room to stretch out but creeps into the aisle. The width of these seats I found a problem the rest are wider which aren't bulkhead. I wanted an exit seat but there aren't any on the BA 747's. It was a cheap flight so wasn't too fussed. Headrests are great BUT they slide down a lot. The seats also have a lot of flex if someone behind leans on yours to get of the seat. TV's are good size but could be bigger.
162,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,"I guess BA are not upgrading WT+ as they retire the 747 fleet. The WT+ cabin is worn shabby and awful - the seat cushioning - so old - it has no ""cushion"" left. On 3 out of 4 sectors on a recent trip - if you are not in Row 28 or 29 the main course menu choices (Club World meal) seemed to be unavailable. With my reservation despite entering Economy as cabin choice it defaulted to World Traveller Plus for more or less the same way. But as other travelers have noted this is NOT worth the extra money. And as for the crew - as tired and worn as the seats."
163,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,JFK-LHR-JFK. Worst legroom I have ever experienced - never been an issue before in 20 years of flying with BA. Paid $75 per seat to have exit aisle seat on return flight. Cabin service was very good.
164,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,Horrible experience on a long haul flight almost claustrophobic. Very easy to physically come into contact with passengers seated next to you. Little room to stretch so the body starts to feel uncomfortable and awkward. Best to move out of the seat and walk to the back of the plane.
165,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,11 hour flight with British Airways. Told at gate that in flight entertainment not working in this seat. No alternative offered by staff. Not even an apology which is what rankles - acknowledging the problem would cost nothing. Appalling attitude by staff. I fly regularly in BA economy class but this kind of thing makes me think again.
166,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,My husband had no working PTV on the way out and was offered a free drink - that was free in any event. Thomson Airways premium economy is much better.
167,Premium Economy,BOEING 777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,We had bulk head seats so plenty of legroom. However the seats were hard and with very little rake. The blankets were inadequate and we froze all night. We think not worth the £250 each extra one way. better off buying a well placed economy seat.
168,Economy Class,AIRBUS A380,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,LHR-FRA-LHR. Sat in the rear economy cabin which is nice. The combination of A380 ride and cabin comfort with the BA economy seat product works well.
169,Economy Class,BOEING 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,Not much legroom and what was there had a metal box taking up loads of space. Deeply uncomfortable. Person in front couldn't recline seat - my legs were crushed right into the back.
170,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,Older 747 but equipment worked. Try not to seat behind the bulkhead seats ie Seat 31 because the leg room is reduced as the seats in front have AVOD equipment under theirs.
171,Economy Class,AIRBUS A319,3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,25B - last row of aircraft and a middle seat. Very little legroom in all seats in this row meant a very uncomfortable flight. Airbus have poorly designed these seats. The edge of the seat in front is moulded in such a way that the seat back in front digs into your knees. Terrible. Avoid at all costs.
172,Premium Economy,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,WT+ from JFK to LHR. I was in the middle seat. Generally I avoid it but in this case I forced by a delay on my scheduled flight so I changed at last minute to catch the flight before. Therefore I scored half point less than when I had an aisle seat in the same cabin. Food is not very good as it is the same from WT. Nice service and amenities.
173,Premium Economy,BOEING 777-200ER,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,I see it as a great deal the seat has a lot more comfort than in WT and you get the business class food which is alright. The only few things I could complain about was the fact that I had to use vile urine smelling lavatories that looked like they had been vandalised. And also the useless uninspiring staff that all looked like they had swallowed a wasp. Four hours into the flight they had got bored and were all playing scrabble on their iPhones at the back of the plane and you had to go and ask them for a drink and even then they gave you the evils and threw it at you. Can't beat a good douse of British hospitality!
174,Economy Class,BOEING 777-200,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,The seat was okay in every way. It was reasonably comfortable (for a 12 hour flight) and the AVOD was reasonable. I am 6ft tall and found the legroom a little tight especially when sleeping but it was okay. The biggest problem was trying to get out from my window seat across two further seats but I am fit and the exercise was good for me.
175,Economy Class,AIRBUS A320,3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Sat in Row 27B and the seats have no recline due to toilets behind. Seat pitch poor felt very cramped especially when person in front reclined seat. Seats not very wide either. Coming back on a A320 again sat in an emergency exit (overwing seat) and even though they were supposed to have a bit more legroom still felt cramped. Glad it was only a 2 hr flight.
176,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,LHR-JFK-LHR. Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening. Best advice is to just complete online check-in early to ensure best seat selection.
177,Economy Class,BOEING 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,Seats looked dated thin and not much leg room either. I was lucky to get a exit seat into the flight so was a bit more happy.
178,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-200,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,The price paid for Traveller Plus is not worth it as the seat width is very poor for the larger person. Power is only for laptop; not c-pap machine as quoted. Solid sided seats with controls on inside of seat and meal tray coming out of arm rest is suitable for small people only. Premium economy is only say 3 points better than economy where Club Class is way ahead.
179,Premium Economy,Boeing 747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,BA for some weird reason insist on using these old planes on the Cape Town to London route preferring to use new planes on the Johannesburg route. We chose the World Traveller Plus product because it is a more spacious seat with a little more recline. But having flown it a few times I have decided that it is not worth the extra money. I'd rather fly economy and save my money for a decent hotel room for a few nights. Why does BA insist on using the old seats and old AVOD system with small screens?
180,Economy Class,Boeing 777-200,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,Only 31 ins legroom which for a 9hr flight felt quite cramped.
181,Economy Class,B767-300,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,Exit row seat on a short haul configured 767. These planes are now very old but are much better than the usual single aisle. The seat was a rather old fabric covered one but was decent. The leather seats in the front half of economy are better though. Excellent leg room due to the exit row.
182,Premium Economy,Boeing747 - 400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,I would pay the extra for premium economy on long haul (but not on BA again) because the alternative is unthinkable. BA's Premium Economy offer on 747s is very poor. The seats were shabby and dilapidated. Access to the light and call buttons was difficult because the are on the inside of the armrest in a narrow seat. The recline was poor and the screen was small (but good choice of films). Everything else - check in food beverages (including some particularly poor white wine) was standard Economy class . TheB 777's apparently have a newer version of premium economy but BA needs to up it's game if it wants to win customers.
183,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,In premium Economy the seat pan was too small and the front of the seat cushion finished half way up my thigh. This cut off the circulation to my legs and made the extendable lower-leg rest totally useless. I am only 6 feet tall so not abnormal!
184,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,WTP London - Orlando. WTP is a big improvement over standard economy but the bigger seat is all you get. The rest of the service is the same as World Traveller. You even have to use the WT toilets. The seat itself is excellent and in my opinion worth paying the extra but BA could add something to make the WTP experience a little special given the price. I would fly BA WTP again but I might try Virgin Premium Economy next time.
185,Economy Class,B747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,"BA has typical 31"" pitch in World Traveller so it's a bit cramped. I like aisle on long hauls for easy access. I've flown SFO-LHR many times on BA. Unless you can score a bulkhead all seats are basically the same."
186,Economy Class,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,no,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,The seat itself was not bad except for being dirty however the IFE was broken for approximately 30-40 people in economy. Some of BA's 777 are very old and are showing it with broken equipment.
187,World Traveller Plus,B747-400,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,I am over six feet tall so booked a word traveller plus cabin seat. Overall very good and one of the few seats where I have been able to stretch out and even cross my legs.
188,Economy Class,B747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"I used to find that British Airways WT seats had very little leg room but this seems to have improved. The seat was comfortable for a 6'00"" guy on a 10.5 hour flight from LHR to SFO. I slept a bit on a day flight and had a good view of the screen (which had a lot of movie and TV choices)"
189,World Traveller Plus,B777,2x3x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,Travelled WT+ and WT on BA on Toronto flights. The seats in WT+ are comfortable and recline well. It is difficult to judge legroom as we were in a cot position on both flights. In terms of comfort WT+ has the edge over WT as we found the seats harder in WT and more difficult to get comfortable which don't help on an 8 hour overnight flight.
190,Economy Class,B777,2x4x2,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,World Traveller Plus cabin. Isle seat next to window seat has restricted foot space due to entertainment electronics under seat in front so swapped for window. Not a bad seat and fine for daytime long haul flights. But sleeping less good. Width feels less than Virgin and Qantas premium economy seats - BA fits the same number across a 777 as the others have in a 747. No AVOD and screen is incredibly small by today's standards. Power socket is low voltage type. Looking old.
191,Economy Class,A319,3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,Euro Traveller OSL-LHR. After flying a lot of low-cost airlines this was a good experience. I had seat 6F with the middle seat empty. Would have felt a bit cramped with a full flight. However the seat width and legroom was good. Checked in online. Fast and easy.
192,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,no,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,LHR-NBO The flight was not full and there were plenty of free seats so I had a row of three to myself. If however I had been on a full flight I would have found it very cramped.
193,Economy Class,Boeing 777,3x3x3,,,,,,,,,,yes,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,9 hour flight from LGW to Orlando on outbound and 7 hours on the way back. Flight was comfortable although as always a little extra legroom in economy would go a long way to enhancing the economy flying experience. Flight out was longer but felt more comfortable on way back sat in row 22A on outbound and 21D on return. IFE was sufficient and kept me occupied!
194,Economy Class,Boeing 747-400,3x4x3,,,,,,,,,,no,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,Seat was very tight on width and i am 6ft with a 34inch waist. Space was okay when forward seat was not reclined but when it was it felt very close and you could not read or use you table. In flight entertainment wasn't fully working either and they made no announcement about this. Seat head rest were poor.
