## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. It involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment of text data.

Here's a small example implementation of sentiment analysis using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize the sentiment analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Define a sample text
text = "I love this product! It works great and exceeded my expectations."

# Analyze the sentiment of the text
sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)

# Print the sentiment scores
print(sentiment)
```

Output:
```
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.146, 'pos': 0.854, 'compound': 0.8625}
```

- In this example, we first import the necessary libraries and initialize the sentiment analyzer using the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` class from NLTK. We then define a sample text and use 
the `polarity_scores()` method to analyze the sentiment of the text. The method returns a dictionary of sentiment scores, including the negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores.

- The compound score represents the overall sentiment of the text, ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive). In this example, the compound score is 0.8625, indicating a highly positive sentiment.
